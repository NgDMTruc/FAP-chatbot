# Chatbot for FPTU Academic Portal

## Project Description
The Chatbot for FPTU Academic Portal project aims to create a chatbot using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to support FPTU students when using the Academic Portal. The chatbot is designed to provide functions such as answering questions, providing information about student services, guiding users on using the Academic Portal, and assisting students with their academic and administrative needs.

## Motivation
Due to the challenges students encounter when searching through the FPTU (FPT University) Academic Portal, student handbooks, or the school's website, we have decided to undertake this research project. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, we aim to streamline and enhance the student experience by developing a customized chatbot tailored to their needs.

## Project Overview
The Chatbot for FPTU Academic Portal project focuses on developing a chatbot using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to interact with university students, answer questions, and provide assistance in various aspects of student life within the FPTU academic portal.

### Database
We gathered data from the Help section of the FPTU Academic Portal, student handbooks, and various sections of the website.
### Methods
In constructing the chatbot, we established a comprehensive pipeline to manage user requests and generate responses through natural language processing. This pipeline involves the following essential components:
- **Embeddings and Vectorstores**: Utilized Hugging Face embeddings and FAISS vectorstores to encode and store textual data.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Employed the VinaLLaMa model to generate responses to user queries based on contextual information.
- **RetrievalQA**: Utilized text processing chains to retrieve and answer user queries by accessing information from various data sources.
